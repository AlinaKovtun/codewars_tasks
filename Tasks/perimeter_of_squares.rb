# The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have
# a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
# It's easy to see that the sum of the
# perimeters of these squares is :
# 4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80
# Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the
# squares in a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares
# disposed in he same manner as in the drawing:
# The function perimeter has for parameter n where n + 1
# is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n)
# and returns the total perimeter of all the squares.

  raise 'Argument should be an positive only' if n < 0
